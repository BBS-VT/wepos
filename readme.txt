wePOS is a fast and responsive( Tablets & Desktop ) WooCommerce Point of Sales plugin. It lets you take orders and track your inventory using your WooCommerce store. You can physically count your WooCommerce products by scanning Bar codes and add them directly to customerâ€™s cart for processing the order.

wePOS is a single page application that works super fast. We have used WooCommerce REST API and some custom API to develop the plugin. This has made the plugin to response fast and gets your work done in time. In a physical store, you get a lot of customers who wait to checkout their products. So, a fast system like wePoS can be your one-way ticket to manage your inventory easily.
